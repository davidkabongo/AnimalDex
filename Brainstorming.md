# Final IOS Project Brainstorm

* Book Tinder/virtual bookshelf - Users keep track of the books they are reading, want to read, and have read. It is like a dumbed-down Goodreads. On the main feed, users can swipe left on a book if they're not interested in reading it and right if they are. They can also long press and select other options ("Already read", "Rate")


* ⭐️ **Animal-dex** (Final App Idea)
    * Description: a pokedex like app which displays information about animals users type in a search bar. Users can save animals into custom collectionsand view information like breed, description, life expectancy, etc.
    * Market: Animal enthusiasts and conservationists
    * Habit: Those that work closely with animals and that need the information for personal reasons will look at this app often
    * Scope: v1 will have basic information and collections while a hypothetical v2 given more time will allow for animal identification given written characteristics or an image.

* ⭐️ Football (⚽️) player performance tracker - users look up a player in the search bar and get their most up to date stats. Users can also compare a player with others.

    * Habit: Those that closely follow their favorite players/teams seasons will look at this project almost daily
    * Scope: v1 will have basic player information like age, nationality, team, position, goals scored, etc. Players can be compared to each other in a comparison view. v2 could have expressive animations.
